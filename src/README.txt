Question: How can I improve the cohesion of my Tetris code by separating the logic for clearing completed rows?
Answer: To enhance the cohesion of your Tetris code, you can separate the logic for clearing completed rows into its own method. This method should focus solely on row clearing without being mixed with other unrelated operations. By grouping operations that work on the same data, you can improve communicational cohesion and make your code more organized and maintainable. Here's an example of how you can refactor the code to achieve this:

Before:

java
Copy code
// Original method for clearing completed rows
public void updateSheet() {
    // Logic for updating the sheet, including clearing completed rows
    // Other unrelated operations mixed with row clearing logic
}
After:

java
Copy code
// Separate method for clearing completed rows
public void clearCompletedRows() {
    // Logic for clearing completed rows only
}

// Method for updating the sheet, now focused on unrelated operations
public void updateSheet() {
    // Logic for updating the sheet, excluding row clearing
}
Question: Can you combine the Move and Rotate actions in my Tetris game to reduce code duplication?
Answer: Certainly! You can combine the Move and Rotate actions in your Tetris game by creating a single Perform interface with a parameter to indicate the action type (move or rotate). This approach reduces code duplication and makes the code more modular and maintainable. Here's how you can refactor the code to achieve this:

Before:

java
Copy code
// Separate classes for Move and Rotate actions
private class Move implements Perform {
    // Move action implementation...
}

private class Rotate implements Perform {
    // Rotate action implementation...
}
After:

java
Copy code
// Combined Perform interface with action type parameter
private interface Perform {
    void perform(int actionType);
}

// Single Perform implementation for both Move and Rotate actions
private class TetrisAction implements Perform {
    // Tetris action implementation...
}
Question: How can I refactor the newPiece() method in my Tetris game without changing its functionality?
Answer: While keeping the functionality intact, you can refactor the newPiece() method in your Tetris game by improving the readability and maintainability of the code. One approach is to introduce named constants for the different Tetris piece configurations and use them instead of hardcoded values. Additionally, you can simplify the code by removing repetitive patterns and using a more concise syntax where applicable. Here's an example of how you can refactor the newPiece() method:

To add the feature of prompting the user to choose a directory for saving the file, you can modify the activate method in the FileSaving class. Here's the updated implementation:

        fileChooser.setDialogTitle("Choose Directory");
        fileChooser.setFileSelectionMode(JFileChooser.DIRECTORIES_ONLY);

        int userSelection = fileChooser.showSaveDialog(null);

        if (userSelection == JFileChooser.APPROVE_OPTION) {
            File directory = fileChooser.getSelectedFile();

                writer.write(rowBuilder.toString());
                writer.newLine();
            }
            prompt.message("Spreadsheet saved successfully.");
        } catch (IOException e) {

    @Override
    public boolean onTick(Prompt prompt) {
        // No tick logic needed for file saving, so returning false
        return false;
    }
}
In this implementation, the activate method now opens a file chooser dialog for the user to choose a directory. Once the user selects a directory and enters a file name, the saveToFile method is called with the full file path for saving the spreadsheet.

cant reslove File directory = fileChooser.getSelectedFile();
ChatGPT
Apologies for the oversight. It seems I missed importing the File class. Let's add the import statement:

java
Copy code
import java.io.File;
After adding this import statement, the code should be able to resolve File directory = fileChooser.getSelectedFile(); without any issues.

User
do the same for reading the file 
ChatGPT
Sure, let's add the necessary import statement for the JFileChooser class and update the activate method in the FileLoading class to utilize it:

java
Copy code
import javax.swing.JFileChooser;
import javax.swing.filechooser.FileNameExtensionFilter;

...

/**
 * Activates the file loading feature.
 *
 * @param i      Unused parameter.
 * @param i1     Unused parameter.
 * @param prompt The prompt for user interaction.
 */
private void activate(int i, int i1, Prompt prompt) {
    JFileChooser fileChooser = new JFileChooser();
    fileChooser.setDialogTitle("Select a File to Load");
    
    // Set filter for file extension
    FileNameExtensionFilter filter = new FileNameExtensionFilter("Text Files", "txt");
    fileChooser.setFileFilter(filter);
    
    // Show open file dialog
    int result = fileChooser.showOpenDialog(null);
    
    // Check if user selected a file
    if (result == JFileChooser.APPROVE_OPTION) {
        File file = fileChooser.getSelectedFile();
        loadFromFile(file.getAbsolutePath());
    }
}
With this update, the activate method in the FileLoading class will utilize a JFileChooser dialog to prompt the user to select a file for loading.

Component #2: Game of Life
Conway’s game of life is a popular cellular automaton. The simulation occurs in a grid of tiles.
Each tile may be either on or off . At each step a simple set of rules are applied to each tile in
order to determine the state (on or off) of the tile in the next step.
The rules are as follows where a neighbour is any tile one step away horizontally, vertically, or
diagonally (giving each tile not on a boundary 8 possible neighbours):
1. Any on cell with fewer than two on neighbours turns off .
2. Any on cell with two or three on neighbours stays on.
3. Any on cell with more than three on neighbours turns off .
4. Any off cell with exactly three on neighbours turns on, otherwise it stays off .
For example:
0
1
2
3
0 1 2 3
tick
−−→
0
1
2
3
0 1 2 3
tick
−−→
0
1
2
3
0 1 2 3
In the above example, moving from the first state to the second state:
 (3, 0) has one on neighbour, so turns off by (1).
 (2, 1) has two on neighbours, so stays on by (2).
 (1, 2) has two on neighbours, so stays on by (2).
 (1, 1) has three on neighbours, so turns on by (4).
 (0, 2) has one on neighbours, so turns off by (1).
Moving from the second state to the third state, (2, 2) has three on neighbours, so turns on by (4).
The games.life.Life class must implement the supplied Feature interface. Life must implement
a constructor that takes a Sheet instance. Within the Life.register(UI) method:
1. A feature to start the game of life simulation must be bound to the identifier "gol-start".
See UI.addFeature.
2. A feature to stop the simulation must be bound to the identifier "gol-end".
See UI.addFeature.
3. An appropriate tick callback must be registered such that when the simulation is running,
the sheet is updated according to the above rules.
See UI.onTick.
Within the spreadsheet, a cell that renders as "1" (without quotes) is considered to be in the on
state. All other cells are considered to be in the off state. When turning a cell off , the sheet
should be updated to insert "" (without quotes) at the cell
ChatGPT
To implement Conway's Game of Life in Java, you can follow these steps:

Define a class named Life that implements the Feature interface.
Implement a constructor in the Life class that takes a Sheet instance as a parameter.
Inside the register(UI) method of the Life class:
Bind a feature to start the Game of Life simulation with the identifier "gol-start".
Bind a feature to stop the simulation with the identifier "gol-end".
Register a tick callback to update the sheet according to the rules of the Game of Life.
Implement the rules of Conway's Game of Life within the tick callback method:
Iterate through each cell of the sheet.
Apply the rules to determine the next state of each cell based on its neighbors.
Update the sheet accordingly.
Here's a basic outline of how you can structure the Life class:

java
Copy code
package games.life;

import sheep.features.Feature;
import sheep.sheets.Sheet;
import sheep.ui.UI;

public class Life implements Feature {
    private final Sheet sheet;
    private boolean running;

    public Life(Sheet sheet) {
        this.sheet = sheet;
        this.running = false;
    }

    @Override
    public void register(UI ui) {
        ui.addFeature("gol-start", "Start Game of Life", this::startGameOfLife);
        ui.addFeature("gol-end", "Stop Game of Life", this::stopGameOfLife);
        ui.onTick(this::tick);
    }

    private void startGameOfLife(int x, int y) {
        running = true;
    }

    private void stopGameOfLife(int x, int y) {
        running = false;
    }

    private boolean isCellAlive(int row, int col) {
        return sheet.valueAt(row, col).getContent().equals("1");
    }

    private void updateCellState(int row, int col, boolean newState) {
        sheet.update(row, col, newState ? "1" : "");
    }

    private void tick() {
        if (!running) return;

        // Implement Game of Life logic here
        // Iterate through each cell, apply rules, and update the sheet
    }
}
You'll need to implement the Game of Life logic within the tick method. This involves iterating through each cell, counting its neighbors, and applying the rules to determine the next state of each cell.
    /**
     * The onTick method is called whenever a tick occurs in the user interface.
     *
     * @param prompt Provide a mechanism to interact with the user interface
     *               after a tick occurs, if required.
     * @return True iff the spreadsheet needs to be re-rendered
     * (i.e. if any cells changed).
     */
    @Override
    public boolean onTick(Prompt prompt) {
        // No tick logic needed for file loading, so returning false
        return false;
    }
}
Now, the activate method uses a JFileChooser to prompt the user to select a file for loading.


java
Copy code
// Original newPiece() method with hardcoded piece configurations
private void newPiece() {
    // Hardcoded piece configurations with repetitive patterns
}
After:

java
Copy code
// Refactored newPiece() method with named constants and simplified logic
private void newPiece() {
    // Piece configurations using named constants
}
These refactorings aim to improve the cohesion, modularity, and readability of your Tetris code while maintaining its functionality.
